<h1>IDEAL LOADOUT IN CH5 S4</h1>

<h2>Note:</h2>

<p>For the opposite ends of the bracket, it is best to equip</p>

<p>an item which does not require you to go to their tab</p>

<p>to use it. There are two such items this season:</p>

<p>The War Machine's Hover Jets and Auto Turret.</p>

<p>Whichever one goes on the left and right end slot depends</p>

<p>on whether the <em>left side</em> or the <em>right side</em> is to be for <em>long</em></p>

<p><em>range</em> or <em>short range</em> respectively.</p>

<h2>First/Last Slot: Mobility Item</h2>

<h3>War Machine's Hover Jets</h3>

<p><img alt="Traverse the battle in the air while firing weapons with precision." src="warmachineshoverjets.png" /></p>

<p>For the edge of the loadout, it is best not to have something</p>

<p>you'll have to switch to often. Here we'll talk about the <strong>War Machine's Hover Jets</strong>.</p>

<p>One of the main advantages of the Hover Jets as a mobility item</p>

<p>is its accessibility. No matter what you're doing, (as long as you're</p>

<p>not standing directly below a low ledge and also facing it, at which</p>

<p>point a mantle will be activated) upon the double click of the jump</p>

<p>button, the hover jets will be activated, and all other controls allow</p>

<p>the use of other items at once, except for Boost, which cancel a lot of</p>

<p>other actions, just like the regular ground dash. You can ascend, descend</p>

<p>via cancelling the jet effect, and perform a boost in horizontal speed.</p>

<p>However, the Hover Jets do consume fuel and even more in Boosts,</p>

<p>but it automatically replenishes every time you haven't activated the</p>

<p>Jets in a while, making it fully self-sustaining; its fuel is more a matter</p>

<p>of stamina than resources.</p>

<p>Through the use of a powerful input combination of</p>

<p>Jump-Jump-Boost-Cancel-Slide</p>

<p>it is possible to 'Jet Skate' through relatively flat terrain while consuming</p>

<p>minimal fuel, and this is even more powerful when combined with a</p>

<p>Flowberry effect.</p>

<h2>Second/Fourth Slot: Long range combat</h2>

<h3>Monarch Pistol/ Striker Ar/ Striker Burst Rifle</h3>

<p>In the second slot, it is good to either have a long-range or close-range</p>

<p>combat item. For long-range, a scoped <strong>Monarch Pistol</strong>, <strong>Striker Ar</strong>, or</p>

<p><strong>Striker Burst Rifle</strong> is best. It is also best that these weapons are modded.</p>

<p>For more information on what the different mods do, <a href="Mod-Information.html">click here</a>.</p>

<p>The three long-range options, Monarch Pistol, Striker AR, and Striker Burst</p>

<p>Rifle, are all quite effective in their own way. However, they each have their</p>

<p>own cons:</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The Monarch Pistol, perhaps akin to a half-sniper, is extremely accurate and can take</p>

<p>out any opponent with a conventional health bar (with the exception of Bosses and Doom’s</p>

<p>Chosen) in two headshots, but is not compatible with the Thermal Scope, so it is arguably</p>

<p>not a good option for nighttime encounters where the opponent can blend in to the dark</p>

<p>background.</p>

<p>The Striker AR, with the right mods, can match the legend of the <a class="styled-link" href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/MK-Seven_Assault_Rifle">MK-Seven Assault Rifle</a>,</p>

<p>which an overwhelming majority of players claim to be their favourite in the history</p>

<p>of the game. It has an extremely high DPS (Damage Per Second) and is much like</p>

<p>an SMG at long-range, but even with Vertical Foregrip and Muzzle Brake mods, the amount of</p>

<p>recoil and bloom makes it impractical at more extreme ranges.</p>

<p>The Striker Burst Rifle is highly accurate and large enough to be compatible with the</p>

<p>Thermal Scope, but simply doesn’t do enough damage to compare with the others.</p>

<p>Here are the ideal mods for each:</p>

<p><img alt="A precise semi-auto weapon" src="monarchpistol.png" /></p>

<h3>Monarch Pistol</h3>

<h4>- <span>Holo-13 Optic/Red Eye Sight</span></h4>

<p>Definitely the most crucial mod. The former has the</p>

<p>highest magnification compatible with this weapon, but the latter allows a better view</p>

<p>of the enemy.</p>

<h4>- <span>Speed Mag</span></h4>

<p>Since the pistol is semi-automatic, it is best to just focus on making</p>

<p>different shots as seamless as possible.</p>

<h4>- <span>Laser/Default Underbarrel</span></h4>

<p>As Laser only works for hipfire and the Monarch Pistol is</p>

<p>a long range weapon, it is practically useless. However it is the only underbarrel small</p>

<p>enough to fit on a pistol. I’d say there’s no harm in keeping it on if it came with the pistol,</p>

<p>but no need to waste time and gold just to equip the Laser mod.</p>

<h4>- <span>Suppressor</span></h4>

<p>With the Monarch Pistol you take one shot at a time (or at least I hope you do),</p>

<p>so there really is no trace of the recoil that is normally present in more rapid-fire weapons.</p>

<p>Can’t go wrong with the Suppressor.</p>

<p><img alt="Fully Automatic Assault Rifle. High fire rate. Most effective when fired in short controlled bursts" src="strikerar.png" /></p>

<h3>Striker AR</h3>

<h4>- <span>Thermal Scope</span></h4>

<p>Though this is not ideal for fast-moving enemies, it allows you to absolutely</p>

<p>destroy some of the milder opponents with brutal speed at mid or long range.</p>

<h4>- <span>Drum Mag</span></h4>

<p>It is best to extend your burst as long as possible. Normally this would be a</p>

<p>terrible idea due to the recoil and bloom that increases the longer you hold the trigger, but</p>

<p>adding the right mods will almost entirely nullify these circumstances.</p>

<h4>- <span>Vertical Foregrip</span></h4>

<p>Without question, this is the most crucial mod. Without it (or the Muzzle Brake)</p>

<p>the recoil and bloom makes it a medium-long range weapon at best.</p>

<h4>- <span>Muzzle Brake</span></h4>

<p>Normally, with the default Striker AR, you would have to aim far below the target</p>

<p>in order to hit them with the maximum amount of rounds, but if the Muzzle Brake</p>

<p>and Vertical Foregrip work together, they can almost nullify this.</p>

<p><img alt="Assault Rifle: Burst-fire rifle with a customized sight." src="strikerburstrifle.png" /></p>

<h3>Striker Burst Rifle</h3>

<h4>- <span>Thermal Scope</span></h4>

<p>Best for the maximum range that the Striker Burst can handle.</p>

<h4>- <span>Speed Mag</span></h4>

<p>It is best to make the different bursts as seamless as possible.</p>

<h4>- <span>Vertical Foregrip/Speedgrip</span></h4>

<p>The former is good for giving the both rounds of</p>

<p>a burst laser-precise accuracy, but the Speedgrip makes strafing easier.</p>

<h4>- <span>Suppressor</span></h4>

<p>There is practically no recoil in this weapon that the Vertical Foregrip doesn’t</p>

<p>handle, so the Suppressor is the better choice.</p>

<h5>It is best to go for the items in their legendary rarity instead of mythic,</h5>

<h5>as mythic weapons do not allow for mods. However, it is up to preference,</h5>

<h5>really, that you should go for a slightly larger damage or customisation.</h5>

<p><img alt="Fire arcane blasts from your fingertips or concentrate your energy into a mystical bomb to devastate your enemies." src="doctordoomsarcanegauntlets.png" /></p>

<h3>Doctor Doom's Arcane Gauntlets</h3>

<p>These are normally obtained by defeating Doombot at Castle Doom,</p>

<p>conventionally at the start of the game, but instead of wasting time and</p>

<p>possibly dying in the process, I recommend sitting tight and hoping that someone</p>

<p>who has them comes your way. If you manage to obtain them, they are an</p>

<p>excellent option from long range, but the blasts are affected by gravity. Unless</p>

<p>you become skilled with managing the gravity and the enemy doesn't move</p>

<p>unpredictably, you are going to have a hell of a time using this weapon over</p>

<p>exceedingly long ranges or while the opponent is situated directly above you.</p>

<h2>Third Slot: Medium range combat</h2>

<h3>Iron Man's Combat Kit/ War Machine's Arsenal</h3>

<p><img alt="Lock-on to targets and fire energy blasts, or launch a piercing Unibeam attack." src="ironmanscombatkit.png" /></p>

<h3>Iron Man's Combat Kit</h3>

<p>The auto-aim function of these gauntlets is really what sets it apart. Their</p>

<p>'crosshair' is merely an inverted triangle that has the special ability of</p>

<p>'locking on' to enemies 'touching' that triangle, denoted by a special circle</p>

<p>that indicates the target it has locked on to. It has a dps of 80, and can</p>

<p>fire for 12 rounds, more or less 3.6 seconds, before entering a cooldown</p>

<p>of 3 seconds. There is also another attack named the Unibeam that takes</p>

<p>2 seconds to fire up while highlighting its future hitbox, does 90 damage</p>

<p>to opponents and 1400 to structures, and has a cooldown of 18 seconds.</p>

<p>The reason the lock-on function of these gauntlets is so valuable is because</p>

<p>they allow for repeated hipfire that would induce extreme amounts of</p>

<p>spread in other weapons, allowing shots to be landed while rapidly moving</p>

<p>through the air. The auto-aim function also makes it possible to spot enemies</p>

<p>concealed by bushes and leaves in trees. However, the auto-aim functions</p>

<p>only work within a certain distance, making them best used exclusively for</p>

<p>mid-range. A very good strategy is to use the War Machine's Hover Jets, fly</p>

<p>above an opponent's head, and use the repulsors from above, as the only</p>

<p>scenario where they do headshot damage is when you are directly, or almost</p>

<p>directly above the opponent.</p>

<p><img alt="Unleash a hailstorm of bullets and rockets at your enemies." src="warmachinesarsenal.png" /></p>

<h3>War Machine's Arsenal</h3>

<p>Because of the Iron Man's gauntlets' notorious reputation and how easy they</p>

<p>make the game, a powerful alternate option is <strong>War Machine's Arsenal</strong>. It has</p>

<p>a relatively high fire rate and dps paired with minimal spread, making it one</p>

<p>of the best weapons for medium range. It also has rockets that you can launch</p>

<p>parallel to the regular bullet mode, for more of the 'spray and pray' feel.</p>

<h2>Fourth/Second Slot: Close-range combat</h2>

<h3>Captain America's Shield/ Smgs/ Shotguns</h3>

<p><img alt="Wield Captain America's vibranium shield and block incoming damage or throw it to hit &amp; bounce between opponents. Charge into enemies when tactical sprinting to send them reeling." src="captainamericasshield.png" /></p>

<h3>Captain America's Shield</h3>

<p>What really makes this weapon ideal is its defense capabilities and the ability</p>

<p>to fight multiple enemies at once. It is best not to hold the 'block' function</p>

<p>for too long, however, as after the shield withstands a certain threshold of</p>

<p>damage within one block, you are forcibly left vulnerable for a few seconds.</p>

<p>You can also throw the shield in order to hit players for 50 damage per throw.</p>

<p>It is not ideal to use it over long distances due to the insane travel time of the</p>

<p>shield that would be required. If there are multiple enemies arounds you,</p>

<p>hitting an enemy will prompt a rebound that causes the shield to hit all of the</p>

<p>enemies near you. It is ideal for boss fights because the boss' minions can be</p>

<p>really irritating while fighting the boss. An ideal strategy is to aim to using the</p>

<p>shield to block the predictable attack patterns of the boss, then throw it out to</p>

<p>hit all the minions.</p>

<p><img alt="Fully automatic dual SMGs. Fire at a very high rate while consuming a lot of ammo. Damage drops substantially at long distances." src="dualmicrosmgs.png" /></p>

<h3>Dual Micro Smgs</h3>

<p>The <strong>Dual Micro Smgs</strong> are another excellent option for close-range,</p>

<p>as they have the highest dps of any weapon in the game currently. The most ideal</p>

<p>situation for this is namely inside the weapons bunkers, where an encounter is</p>

<p>decidedly dangerous due to the lack of cover and space. It is best to venture into</p>

<p>these with a close-range weapon that can deal lots of damage and kill the enemy</p>

<p>before they do you. As you may have guessed from the image, this item does not</p>

<p>support mods, so it has no optimisation features like other weapons.</p>

<p><img alt="Fires at a very high fire rate, dealing significant damage at close range while consuming ammo quickly" src="hypersmg.png" /></p>

<h3>Hyper Smg</h3>

<p>Alternate options to the Dual Micro Smgs in close-range scramble fights include the</p>

<p><strong>Hyper Smg</strong>, which allows mods at the cost of a somewhat lower dps. These would</p>

<p>optimally be the <span>Red Eye Sight</span>, the <span>Drum Mag</span>, the <span>Laser</span> (<span>Vertical Foregrip</span> is not that</p>

<p>bad if you plan on using it at longer ranges), and the <span>Muzzle Brake</span> mods.</p>

<p><img alt="Rapid fire automatic shotgun with a triangular spread. Deals high damage over a short range and has a limited magazine size." src="gatekeepershotgun.png" /></p>

<h3>Gatekeeper Shotgun</h3>

<p>A relatively rapid-fire shotgun that can eliminate an enemy with full health and</p>

<p>shields withing 2 seconds by landing all three rounds. This is actually one of the best</p>

<p>crosses between pump shotguns and auto shotguns in Fortnite history, having a</p>

<p>relatively high fire rate, dps, and individual round damage respectively. The ideal mods</p>

<p>are the <span>Default Iron Sights</span>, <span>Drum Mag</span>, <span>Laser</span> (<span>Angled Foregrip</span> is also useful if you prefer</p>

<p>to use the Gatekeeper at longer ranges), and <span>Muzzle Brake</span>.</p>

<p><img alt="A rapid, hip-fire shotgun that slows down when aiming down sights, but gains a significant Increase in precision." src="sovereignshotgun.png" /></p>

<h3>Sovereign Shotgun</h3>

<p>This versatile weapon is especially valuable for Zero Build Mode, where the Hover Jets</p>

<p>combined with open ground allow for skillful shots. The ideal mods are the <span>Default Iron</span></p>

<p><span>Sights</span>, <span>Default Mag</span>, <span>Laser</span>, and <span>Suppressor</span>.</p>

<h2>Last/First Slot: Automation/Heals</h2>

<h3>War Machine's Auto Turret/ Chug Splashes</h3>

<p><img alt="Vigilant shoulder mounted auto turret that provides battle ready support fire." src="warmachinesautoturret.png" /></p>

<h3>War Machine's Auto Turret</h3>

<p>This item automatically locks onto one nearby target at a time and does 27.5 dps consistently.</p>

<p>This makes it valuable for aiding fights and spotting enemies.</p>

<p><img alt="Works wonders. Restores all of your health gradually." src="medkit.png" /><img alt="A potion with insulating properties. Applies some shields." src="shieldpotion.png" /><img alt="A potion that has the consistency of jelly. Applies a small amount of shields." src="smallshieldpotion.png" /><img alt="Toss to splash all nearby players. Instantly applies Health and Shields to those in splash area." src="chugsplash.png" /><img alt="Fizz up and spray to grant continuous shields and low-grav to you and your allies!" src="flowberryfizz.png" /></p>

<h3>Heals</h3>

<p>In terms of the amount of healing, a full stack of <strong>Med Kits</strong> or <strong>Shield Potions</strong> have the best effect,</p>

<p>but neither of them heal both health and shield. <strong>Small Shield Potions</strong> and <strong>Chug Splashes</strong> heal very</p>

<p>quickly, but Small Shields can only go up to 50 shield, and Chug Splashes are quite rare. <strong>Flowberry</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fizz</strong>, on the other hand, has another utility aspect, and that is granting 10 seconds of the low</p>

<p>gravity effect every time you finish spraying, aside from 100 shield in every bottle. The kind of</p>

<p>heals you go for is up to personal preference, as they have different pros and cons, but personally,</p>

<p>I see a full stack of 6 Chug Splashes as most valuable.</p>

<p><img alt="Fly across the map at blistering speeds with Iron Man's Flight Kit, press the fire button while flying to quickly change direction, speed up, and ram into players and structures.
If Iron Man's Combat Kit is also in your inventory, press alt-fire while flying to use your unibeam attack without exiting flight." src="ironmansflightkit.png" /></p>

<h2>Iron Man's Flight Kit</h2>

<p>This is the item most ideal for rotations (Long Distance Travel), aside from a Whiplash Vehicle. It is</p>

<p>an appealing item if you prefer fast-paced games with lots of travel, or if you just need a way of</p>

<p>getting around the map while you visit different locations to assemble your loadout.</p>

<h2>Fortnitemares Update</h2>

<h4>Due to the removal of Jet Packs and the addition of <strong>Chainsaws</strong> in the Fortnitemares Update,</h4>

<h4>the situation of the mobility items became complicated. Three new mobility items became the best,</h4>

<h4>the Chainsaw, <strong>Shuri's Black Panther Claws</strong>, and Iron Man's Flight Kit.</h4>

<p><img alt="Hack your way through enemies or rev your saw into the ground to propel yourself forward at frightening speeds!" src="chainsaw.png" /></p>

<h3>Chainsaw</h3>

<p>This item serves as a mobility item through the use of the chain as a propellor to propel yourself</p>

<p>across the ground for 10 seconds, with a cooldown of 10 seconds. This allows you to constantly stay</p>

<p>moving, as when the fuel supply runs out you can simply use the dash and slide mechanic to stay</p>

<p>moving. The <strong>Chainsaw</strong>'s brilliant offense capabilities at close range also makes it valuable as you can</p>

<p>swap out your Dual Micro Smgs for this, using that slot for something else like Cap's Shield or heals.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the Dual Micro Smgs are still better at extreme close combat, though.</p>

<p><img alt="Shuri's own Black Panther Claws enable the wearer to swiftly navigate the battlefield. The weapon absorbs kinetic energy that can be used to supercharge its devastating offensive capabilities." src="shurisblackpantherclaws.png" /></p>

<h3>Shuri's Black Panther Claws</h3>

<p>Though this item, like the chainsaw, is classified as a weapon, it has limited capabilities in this aspect.</p>

<p>The main reason you would pick this item up is for mobility, through activating a 'pounce' by pressing</p>

<p>the attack button mid-air, which propels you forward in a burst. Though they travel faster and move</p>

<p>in less predictabe patterns than the Chainsaw, their main weakness is that they use your stamina to</p>

<p>travel, and therefore when you run out of stamina, you must run at a regular pace, making the Captain</p>

<p>America's Shield twice as valuable. The Supercharge function does improve some of this. The claws</p>

<p>have a kinetic energy percentage that charges slowly over time, but sprinting with the claws on makes</p>

<p>it charge faster. When the percentage reaches 100, you can supercharge the claws, giving you unlimited</p>

<p>stamina and increased travel distance and combat capability (with the claws) over a short period of time.</p>

<p>The Supercharge function makes them viable for 'weapons bunker' type fights, where the claws' control</p>

<p>in combat could make them rival the chainsaw.</p>

<h3>.</h3>

<p>Although the Chainsaw and <strong>Black Panther Claws</strong> have similar capabilities, both are relatively equal in terms</p>

<p>of valuability. However, the Chainsaw scores high in endurance and combat while the Black Panther Claws</p>

<p>have a lot of agility and control.</p>

<h3>Changes in other slots</h3>

<p>Because of the adequate close-range capabilities of the Chainsaw and Black Panther Claws, the fourth/second</p>

<p>slot is opened up. If you went for the Black Panther Claws, Captain America's Shield might still be good, as you need a</p>

<p>means of protection while stopping because of stamina running out. If you used the Chainsaw, some heals</p>

<p>might be useful, or Iron Man's Flight Kit.</p>
